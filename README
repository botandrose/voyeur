DESCRIPTION
Voyeur is a stupidly simple Thor task we use internally at BOTandROSE design to ensure our sites are up. It parses a YAML file for config, loops through a list of uris, GETs them, and emails us if the response is not 200. Meant to be cron'ed or something similar.

SETUP
copy the config.yml.example to config.yml and customize to your needs.

USAGE
thor voyeur:peek
